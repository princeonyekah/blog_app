# [Title] Design Document

## Introduction

### Non-Goals

If there are related problems that you have decided not to address with this design, but which someone might conceivably expect you to solve, then list them here.

## Proposed Design

Start with a brief, high-level description of the solution. The following sections will go into more detail.

### System Architecture

If the design consists of a collaboration between multiple large-scale components, list those components here â€” or better, include a diagram.

### Data Model

Describe how the data is stored. This could include a description of the database schema.

### Interface/API Definitions

Describe how the various components talk to each other. For example, if there are REST endpoints, describe the endpoint URL and the format of the data and parameters used.

### Business Logic

If the design requires any non-trivial algorithms or logic, describe them.
